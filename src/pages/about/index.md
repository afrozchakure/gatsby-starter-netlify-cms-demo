Hey, thanks for reading this far. My name is Afroz Chakure and I'm a final year student currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and engineering at MIT-WPU, Pune. 

Other than that I'm a Passionate Blogger with love for AI and Machine Learning. When I'm not coding you can find me reading books and just surfing the internet :D

# About this Site

This is one of my Personal blogs where I share my love for latest technologies with others by trying to explain complicated things in simple words.

> “What started off as a hobby has turned into passion”.

I believe technology is there to make our lives easier and better. With the help of technologies like A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) , V.R. (Virtual Reality) and Quantum Computing, I feel humans will be able to solve some of mankind’s most difficult problems.

With every new technology comes newer problems and as humans it is our responsibility to find solutions to those problems while keeping our ethical values and beliefs intact.

Most of these blogs are on Machine Learning, where I have tried to simplify some of the most commonly used ML Algorithms. Any constructive feedback is much appreciated.
